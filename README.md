# HHA504 Assignment 5: MongoDB Async Module & Badge Completion

You will complete two MongoDB University modules asynchronously. You must complete each course and earn the associated **badge**.

1. **MongoDB Overview** (Approx. 60 minutes)

## Reflection:

1. One or two key differences that stood out to you between relational databases (e.g., MySQL) and non-relational/document databases (e.g., MongoDB).

One key difference that stood out to me between relational databases (e.g., MySQL) and non-relational/document databases (e.g., MongoDB) is that relational databases stores data using tables with columns and rows while non-relational/document databases stores data in the form of JSON-like documents Another key difference is that relational databases require predefined schemas and data models to structure the data. In non-relational databases, documents consist of a series of key-value pairs of varying type. It allow for more flexibility since the data structure can vary from document to document without the need for schema changes.

2. One **healthcare-specific** scenario where using a non-SQL database like MongoDB would be appropriate, and why.

One healthcare-specific scenario where using a non-SQL database like MongoDB would be appropriate is storing and managing data for electronic health records (EHRs). Some of the data in EHRs, such as patient demographics, medical histories, and lab results, can vary widely in structure and format. A non-SQL database like MongoDB can help healthcare providers store all of the information together in a document without needing to redesign the database each time a new data type is added. This makes it easier to integrate and access patient information efficiently.
